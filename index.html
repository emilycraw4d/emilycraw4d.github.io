Originally, the data is pulled from National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration’s database. Though the github contains multiple csvs of preprocessed data, I chose the csv that represented temperature change estimates per state.
However it is to be noted the dataset excludes Alaska and Hawaii. I’m not quite sure why only the “Lower 48” states were analyzed, though I assume this has to do with the way the data is stored by NOAA. 
For my visualization, I have a simple bar graph that represents the average temperature change in a certain period in Celsius between 1895 - 2019 for each state. 
The user can toggle a menu that decides what period of the year the graph will represent. One can choose between seasons or the year as a whole. 
I thought it would be interesting to explore which states had the greatest change and in what period of the year the temperature change can be seen the most. 
It is also interesting to note almost every state had Winter as the season where the greatest change in temperature occurred.</p></div></div></div></div>
